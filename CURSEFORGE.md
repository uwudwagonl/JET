### Smart Search System
- **Text Search**: Find items by typing their name - try searching for `#weapon` to see all weapons
- **Namespace Filtering**: Use `@modname` to filter items by mod (e.g., `@wanmine` shows only WanMine mod items)
- **Exclusion Filters**: Use `-term` to exclude items from results
- **Category Filters**: Quick-access buttons for Tools, Weapons, Armor, Consumables, Blocks, and more
 
### Recipe Viewing
Click any item to see its complete crafting information on the right panel. The interface shows you exactly what materials you need, how many you currently have, and what workbench tier is required.
